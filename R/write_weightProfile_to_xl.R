#' Write weight profiles to an Excel spreadsheet
#'
#' Weight profiles are lists of vectors with weights. Every vector is named,
#' with the names being the criterion identifiers of the criterion each weight
#' corresponds to. Every named vector (i.e. very weight profile) also has
#' an attribute that is another named vector: the weights of the criteria
#' clusters. Those are named vectors, too (again, with the names being the
#' criteria identifiers, but this time of the criteria clusters).
#'
#' @param weightProfiles The weightprofiles object, for example as created
#' by a call to [create_weight_profile()].
#' @param file The file to write to.
#'
#' @return Invisibly, the list of dataframes that's written to the file.
#' @export
