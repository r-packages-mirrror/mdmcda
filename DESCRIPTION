Description: Complex decisions can be hard to oversee. To assist in
    such efforts, Multi Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) has been developed.
    This package implements functionality for Multi Decision Multi Criteria
    Decision Analysis (MDMCA). This is a form of MCDA to select a scenario:
    a specific configuration of selected alternatives within a set of
    decision. A common use case is comparing substance policies, where each
    policy (scenario) is defined as a series of selected alternatives for
    a set of policy instruments (decisions).
